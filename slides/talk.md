- Language 'features'
- Reflection
- Annotations
- External libraries

# Ratings

# You should probably

* `URLClassLoader` is `Closeable`
  * `close()` it, I guess?
* `CompilationTask` has lots of error data
  * Do something with that

use annotations

to trick the Java _**compiler**_

into generating bytecode

that does something else

# Singletons

"[An enum] provides an ironclad guarantee against multiple instantiation, even in the face of sophisticated serialization or reflection attacks. [...] A single-element enum type is often the best way to implement a singleton"
